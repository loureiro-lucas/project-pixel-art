# Pixel Art Project ðŸš€

In this project we had to develop a webpage with a color palette with four different color, the first one always black. This palette should be used to color a block of squares right bellow. The block size shoud be chosen by a user input, and a button to delete de design was also a requirement.

Developing it I could learn and train my **JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML** skills, as well as my ability to manipulate the **DOM**.
